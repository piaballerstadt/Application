Welcome to Application's documentation!
=======================================

The :mod:`Application`-module provides some basic functionality useful for an application. This includes functions
for simple *logging*, *configuration management*, *initialization*, *argument parsing* or simply *accessing platform
specific paths* like paths for caches, logging files, configuration- or data files.
